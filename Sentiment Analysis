Reviews:\n[1] \"This restaurant came to my attention when I was browsing for food on Uber Eats while at work. It's located near the Times Square area -- so my assumption is office workers probably stop by to pick up food.The menu has a lot to offer. It's your one-stop shop for all kinds of Asian cuisines. There are drinks (coffee, bubble tea, fruit tea, slushies, juices, smoothies), meals (sushi & sashimi, bento boxes, sushi burrito, poke bowls, dim sum, hot pot, dry pot, noodle soups, stir fry Chinese dishes), and Asian desserts. All the foods seem reasonably priced as well for the area. Some items do seem slightly pricey. I ordered the custom poké bowl with salmon and shrimp as my proteins. It was delicious, full, and filling. All the ingredients looked and tasted fresh. Beautiful presentation and exactly what I expected in terms of a poké bowl. On par, in terms of price as well. When I came to pick up my meal, my food was ready. The restaurant looked clean, brightly lit, and comfy. There were several people seated inside and eating/chatting with their friends during the lunch hour. It looks like a nice spot to chat and get a quick bite.

Most hot pot places are AYCE so I'm glad I came across this place which had a hot pot soup for one. I have to say I'm usually good with spice but the mild spicy was pretty spicy! Order accordingly if you are sensitive to spice. This broth was different than most others I've had in the sense that it was more pungent/sour. The broth was rich but for some reason, it didn't marry well with all the other ingredients. Hot pot is also usually served with a bowl of rice, and considering the price, it's disappointing that wasn't included.

Sounds like a weird combination, I know. I had originally just planned on getting sushi but when I see dry pot on a menu, I can't not get it. The flavors of the dry pot were unusual.. I can't put my finger on it but reminded me of beef chili. It wasn't awful, and the actual ingredients seemed good quality, but I wouldn't get it again. The tuna roll was ok. I ordered delivery and they put it on top of the dry pot so the sushi was very warm when it arrived - I suggest better packaging in regards to integrity of food temperature. Overall it was ok, got a lot of food for the price. Maybe will just stick to the sushi and visit in-restaurant if I try again.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n\n[10] \"Hello, KaitlinThank you for your review.

The first time I got a tofu poke bowl with a nice variety vegetables in it and it was very tasty and filling. The second time I got a soup noodle bowl with veggies, which was good, but it didn't have much tofu in it so it wasn't as filling as I wanted it to be. Maybe I could have asked/paid to have extra tofu or something.I've also gotten a couple different bubble teas from here, which are pretty decent. The tapioca has always been the right texture, and the drinks are overly not watered down like in some other places. I like that the ice level and sweetness can be adjusted and alternative non-dairy milks can be used (although the non-dairy milks are rather expensive to add ... a whole dollar ... on top of the price of adding boba).The handful of times I've been there, the noise level is average - mostly the staff and other customers talking inside. But the last time I went, there were some girls who were probably high schoolers outright yelling as they were laughing with each other. I don't know how often it is like that, but it was rather off-putting and I couldn't relax until after they left and the inside was back down to average noise.The staff for the most part is helpful. I've usually either ordered online or on their kiosks, but I once tried to ask which (if any) of their bubble teas had little or no caffeine. And the older guy who was working there told me that the bubble teas would have no caffeine if made with non-dairy creamer, which led me to believe he was confusing caffeine with lactose or something. One of the other ladies behind the counter was able to tell me which bubble teas didn't have caffeine so that I wouldn't have been kept up that night. I appreciated that.\"\n\n[13] \"I was craving some dumplings and this place was nearby. Going in it was empty and i ordered through their machine but you can order in person as well. They have a variety of options. The food took sbout 15 min but they were made as fresh as it can be. I would like it if they had a different dipping option. The dumpling was nice and crisp as it was fried.

There is so much variety here, from sushi to noodles to soup to appetizers. BUT this is a bubble tea review. The teas themselves here are in general super refreshing. They weren't necessarily the best teas we've ever had but they definitely weren't the worst either. If you're in the area and want to have a nice lil drink with a meal (again, they have a HUGE selection of hot food items), this place is a really good option.We ordered (rating): the Lychee Fairy (4/5), Honey Lemon Black Tea with Boba and Grass Jelly (4/5), Cheese Foam Peach Green Tea with Grass Jelly (3.5/5), Coconut Milk Tea with Boba (3.75/5), Galaxy Yogurt (1/5), Passionfruit Green Tea (4.5/5)Even though my coconut milk tea was made of powder, the powder was blended into the tea so that there weren't any residual granules. It had a strong coconut flavor but it veered slightly on the watery side. The lychee fairy was tasty and came with good hecking clear boba but it was reallyyy sugary which is unfortunate when you can't adjust the sugar level. The one drink that fell really short compared to all the others was the Galaxy Yogurt. It essentially tasted like sugar water, not the yakult that was as advertised. Even though the drink was super pretty and came highly recommended by the store, nothing was notable about it except for the jelly that came with it. The boba had the texture that we love (chewy, with some bounce, and not too soft), and they didn't have that super sweet brown sugar taste that you might be used to from other stores, but they were very lightly sweetened so they didn't taste like plastic or chewable water. If you like a pretty firm boba, you'd definitely enjoy the boba here.Our drink average came to around 3.5/5, but we rounded down because of how much time it took to make them. We waited approximately 30 (THIRTY) minutes for these six drinks which is almost unheard of. If a drink order is going to take THAT much time, a heads up beforehand would be nice.We'd recommend the Passionfruit Green Tea!\"\n\n[12] \"Very rude service. Came in 15 mins before closing fordinning in. After paying at kiosk in the front, we were sitting at the table waiting for the food to come out. After a little bit, an old man (maybe the owner) passed by. We asked if it was ok for us to eat there if it passed 10:30pm (their closed time). The man said yes. But 5 mins after, a woman called us to the pick up counter to pick up the food. Our hotel room is very small and we ordered hot soup so we  decide to eat there. Then the woman slammed the chairs close by. My husband said that  the old man said it was ok to eat even after they were closed. She said that they were closed at 10:30pm. If that was the case, why did she not tell us right after we ordered for dinning in at the kiosk? I even gave them tip because I thought we could eat there. Never come back again.

I had the lo mein and boba from here - I enjoyed the lo mein, however it was a bit oily for my taste. It was dripping out of the Tupperware. But taste wise it was pretty fine. I've had better boba in the past but I appreciated the different flavor offerings. Delivery service was not the best though and I think it can be improved, it was difficult communicating with the delivery driver when I was asking for more details about the status of my order. Overall, food is 4/5, and delivery service is 2/5\"\n\n[1] \"I was surprised to find this place for good Chinese food open on Christmas Day. I was able to find this place through Yelp after my friends and I had trouble looking around for something that was open -- Props to the staff for working through the holiday. I liked the mushroom rib noodles, though the noodles are a bit thicker than I like, they were perfect for a cold day. The passion fruit green tea tastes refreshing and goes well with the piping hot noodles. If I am craving authentic Chinese food and I'm in the area around Port Authority or Times Square, I will come back to probably try another noodle or rice dish. There is a great variety of food and the place is clean. I probably wouldn't come for the sushi and there are other poke places nearby so I would come for the Chinese dishes.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n\n [2] \"It's surprising to see a good tea spot near Port Authority/Times Square but I'll take it. I haven't tried their Sichuan food (probably will happen) or sushi (definitely won't) but the tea here is good. I went to their original location once a while ago in Chelsa and it was also good. They sell osmanthus oolong which is a nice change from other places and I got it with aloe vera. It takes 5/10 minutes as it's fresh brewed which I am fine with. It wasn't too sweet as wanted and there and a lot of aloe.

Cold noodles - I was hoping for an okay cold noodles after I was disappointed with order from else where the day before, however, the cold noodles blew my mind! It's so flavorful and authentic, just like what I remembered from the street vendor near my middle school. The noodle bowl has garlic, bean sprouts, sliced cucumber, fried peanuts and scallions. The sauce may contain sugar, soy sauce, cumin, chili oil that's more fragrant rather than spicy. Don't quote me, but if you are possibly allergic with any of these ingredients, double check with the restaurant before you order. Cheese Strawberry Tea - I got 50% sugar and I liked how it tasted. I would assume by default it comes with the cheese foam on the top, but Seamless has an option to add cheese foam so I selected it. I believe I tasted green tea in there, it's not just a strawberry juice drink. Seamless Experience - no delivery fee charge is one of the reasons I decided to try this place. Believe it or not, ordering from Seamless is much more expensive with all those delivery fees, higher marked prices, and oddly over 8.875% sales taxes. Anyway, I think the delivery was made by the restaurant directly, the noodle sauce was nicely and securely packed, not making a mess in the takeout bag; the right size of container was used for the noodles, leaving enough room to mix the noodles after putting the sauce in; the food arrived promptly. Overall I would definitely order from here again, the tough part would be whether to stick with these choices or try something new.\"\n\n [6] \"If you want overpriced noodles and your boba tea to come out as soon as your finished eating this is the place for you :).\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n\n [8] \"Went to MomenTea for bubble tea and it was great.

I came with a friend on a weekday night at 7pm, and we each ordered the spicy beef noodle soup and shrimp har gau dumplings. The restaurant set up and ambiance is like their Chelsea location. Austere, brightly lit lights, giving vibes of a more low-key fast casual spot. Their menu is more expansive compared to their Chelsea location - In addition to their expansive pokebowl and impressive fruit/boba tea meNu, the owner harkens back to her Chinese roots by featuring some classic Chinese dishes, such as a variety of different noodles and rice dishes. Concept wise I think it's fantastic as it adds a breadth of diversity to the surprisingly lack of fast casual Chinese restaurants in the Times square area.Now for the food. Since I've had experience with their boba (galaxy tea) and pokebowl (momentea special), I wanted to try their Chinese menu. The noodles were fantastic in their spicy beef noodle soup. The heat was at the right balance, and the spices do elevate a lot of the meaty flavors present in the broth. The food was seasoned well. I personally do prefer my broth to be developed with a little more beefy flavor , so I do recommend trying the make the broth a little thicker than what it is. The shrimp hau gau dumplings were fantastic, tasting exactly like its from a traditional Cantonese dim sum shop, and you get six for one order!Price point is pretty reasonable, and you can expect between $10-$15 per entree. Service was fast and efficient. Many thanks to the owner, Katrina, for hosting me!Glad to have found this spot, as it adds one more place for me to visit whenever I'm hungry for a quick and casual eat in times square!\"\n\n[14] \"I ordered their Lychee Rose Green Tea through UberEats delivery, and it was sooo good.

I got a taro milk tea with boba.i adjusted the sweetness to 50% but I'm not sure if they actually made the adjustment as it was as sweet (if not sweeter) than what I eould expect at 100% sweetness at other places I've been. The boba was slightly overcooked so it wasn't as chewy as freshly cooked boba too so that was a bit diappointing. Especially for over $6 for a drink, which is on the more expensive end... But I do have to say, they have a very impressive menu. Lots of options from some chinese classics, to poke, to sushi. I will probably come back to try some food in the future, since it did look pretty good, but probably won't be getting any drinks from here anymore. Overall, everything could be done self serve at a kiosk (or you can order in peron) and there is plenty of seating and places to get work done. It took about 5-10 minutes to get my drink after placing the order on the kiosk. I would give the drink a 3/5, service a 3/5, and environment a 4/5.\"\n\n [9] \"The tea is decent...if you like waiting around 30 minutes for a bubble tea.

You can't help but wonder where they got so many creative ideas on bringing uniqueness to their beverage presentation.I really like their Braised Pork Meatball as well! I was told that the meatballs are freshly made daily by the chef and his team. Well, at dine-in restaurants you will find freshly made meatballs quite expensive on menus.

Their classic milk tea has a very \\\"tea shop\\\" flavor, and I really like it as well. I've had a chance to try a variety of their food, and I've liked everything so far. For a place with such a large food menu and completely different types of foods, the food quality is really high. My favorite dishes are the spicy noodle dishes - they are delicious and made really well. I liked the pork soup dumplings quite a bit as well. The poke is not the best I've had, but it wasn't bad (fish did taste fresh, which is the most important thing imo). I still need to try their bento boxes - I bet they are pretty good too given the high quality of everything else.Overall this is a great place to get great boba and delicious food at the same time.

I have no clue what his issue was, I walked in and ordered my boba, nothing more and nothing less.

They have so many menu options from bubble tea to noodles to poke bowls. The bubble tea options are also more unique than your typical ones- we got the lychee mojito (lychee green tea and mint flavors) and Galaxy yogurt butterfly pea flower tea (yakult and passion fruit jelly) which were both super delicious! The bubbles were also the perfect texture. As for meals we tried the salmon poke bowls. The spicy salmon poke bowl came with tons of yummy toppings- edamame, mango, corn, wasabi tobiko, seaweed salad, and was topped with a sriracha aioli. My friend loved her yuzu citrus salmon bowl, topped with pineapple, corn, Bonito flakes, onion crisps, and yuzu shoyu. Not only were the bowls very aesthetic they also tasted delicious! Overall a solid place to grab a quick bite or bubble tea. Will definitely be back to try more of their menu options like the noodles next time !\"\n\n [2] \"The food are Great, chicken noodle soup is really delicious! also Becky is the best!!\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n\n [5] \"Their beef noodle is my favorite!!!Try the lychee rose tea too, amazing.The staff are all very friendly, it has a comfy atmosphere.

Maybe fried noodles are supposed to be more oily, but they just didn't taste good). These fried noodles were also spicy, wtf. Traditional lo mein noodles are not supposed to be spicy at all!

It was not very busy at 6pm on a Sunday. I ordered the braised pork belly and a Thai tea boba milk tea. The good:*good flavor on braised pork belly, not too salty*short wait for food*clean with a lot of seating*boba is of correct consistency The bad:*not very aromatic Thai tea, probably a 2/10 in terms of flavor. Definitely not condensed milk used like traditional Thai tea which was pretty disappointing. The scoop is that it's powdered milk according to the cashier. *plastic everything. I dined in and my bento box was a cheap plastic container comparable to a school lunch tray. So disappointing and tacky. Not only bad for the environment but also for your health. *rice is dry*cabbage is over boiled. *cashier seemed very bothered I came in at all and too uninformed to make a recommendation despite me saying it was my first time in.

They forgot 2 of the items I ordered and I was really upset as one of them was something they charged me extra for.

I am not sure why they kept pointing me in the wrong direction to get sauce, that was non existent, when in the end it was behind the counter AND I never got any wasabi.

Then after waiting I kid you not 30 MINUTES for ONE bubble tea they tell my boyfriend they don't have bubbles, at this point Im mad and they are serving everyone before us so I tell them what is the problem and the guy argues with me there are all these people and I told him Look at my Receipt! I have been here for 30 minutes and None of these people were here before me I promise. \\\"He yelled we are doing our best\\\" and I was just shocked.Literally how hard is it hard is it to put some powder in some hot water.....AND NONE of them apologized, offered a refund or anything. This place is a reck. I should report it to the health department.I promise you if you look at the kitchen you will regret ever coming here.To boot this is on Christmas, these people ruined our Christmas when all we wanted was a bubble tea and accepted the fact its dirty powdered water.
